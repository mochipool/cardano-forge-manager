# Refactor: Removed Unnecessary Cluster Management Availability Checks

## Changes Made

Based on the observation that the `cluster_manager` module is always available as part of the codebase, we removed unnecessary import availability checks and simplified the code logic.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/forgemanager.py`

**Removed:**
- `CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT_AVAILABLE = True` constant
- All `if CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT_AVAILABLE:` conditional checks

**Changes:**
- Direct import: `from . import cluster_manager` (no try/catch needed)
- Direct initialization: `cluster_manager.initialize_cluster_manager(custom_objects)`
- Direct function calls without availability checks:
  - `cluster_manager.should_allow_local_leadership()`
  - `cluster_manager.update_cluster_leader_status()`
  - `cluster_manager.get_cluster_metrics()`
  - `cluster_manager.get_cluster_manager()`

#### 2. `integration_example.py`

**Removed:**
- Try/catch block around `ClusterManager` initialization
- Fallback to `None` on initialization errors

**Changes:**
- Simplified `initialize_cluster_manager()` function to directly create and start the cluster manager when enabled
- Removed unnecessary error handling that was masking real configuration issues

#### 3. `tests/test_cluster_management.py`

**Removed:**
- `@patch('cluster_manager.CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT_AVAILABLE', True)` decorator from test

## Rationale

### Before (Unnecessary Complexity)
```python
# Bad: Checking if module is available when it's always part of the codebase
try:
    from . import cluster_manager
    CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT_AVAILABLE = False

# Bad: Conditional checks everywhere
if CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT_AVAILABLE:
    cluster_manager.do_something()
else:
    logger.warning("Cluster management not available")
```

### After (Simplified)
```python
# Good: Direct import since it's always available
from . import cluster_manager

# Good: Use environment variable to control behavior
if ENABLE_CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT:
    cluster_manager.do_something()
else:
    logger.info("Cluster management disabled")
```

## Key Benefits

1. **üßπ Cleaner Code**: Removed unnecessary conditional logic and constants
2. **üéØ Proper Control Flow**: Uses `ENABLE_CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT` environment variable as the single source of truth
3. **üêõ Better Error Handling**: Real import or initialization errors are no longer masked
4. **üîß Easier Testing**: Tests don't need to mock availability flags
5. **üìñ Improved Readability**: Code logic is more straightforward and easier to follow

## Control Mechanism

The cluster management functionality is now controlled solely by the **`ENABLE_CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT`** environment variable:

- `ENABLE_CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT=true`: Enables full cluster-wide coordination
- `ENABLE_CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT=false` (default): Runs in traditional single-cluster mode

This provides **backward compatibility** while enabling the new cluster-wide features when explicitly requested.

## Migration Impact

‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing deployments continue to work unchanged
‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: Single-cluster mode remains the default
‚úÖ **Cleaner Architecture**: Separation between "available" vs "enabled" is now clear

This refactor makes the code more maintainable and eliminates a common source of confusion between module availability and feature enablement.
